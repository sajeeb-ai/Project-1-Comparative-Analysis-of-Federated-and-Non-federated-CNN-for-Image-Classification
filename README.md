# Project-1: Comparative Analysis of Federated and Non federated CNN for Image Classification

Federated learning allows multiple parties to train a machine learning model collaboratively without sharing their local data. Handling the heterogeneity of local data distribution across parties is a crucial challenge in federated learning. Federated learning offers secure models without data sharing, resulting in a highly effective privacy-preserving approach that both offers security and data access. Despite the fact that many studies have been proposed to address this issue, we find that deep learning models fail to achieve high performance in image datasets. In this research, we have analyzed the performance of federated and non-federated CNNs. When testing non-federated CNN, we are able to reach 56% accuracy, while federated CNN is tested on the server we have achieved 59.62% accuracy. The CIFAR10 dataset (public) has been used to evaluate our models.
